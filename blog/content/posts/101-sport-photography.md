Till now I am using canon 800D it's not the perfect camera but it's the best I have found so far for my budget, It's seems that the 80D is better for the price. 
For lenses it's recommended to use one of these ones : 
medium budget :
 - Objectif EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM
 - Objectif EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM
higher budget :
 - SIGMA 70-200MM/2.8 DG OS HSM Sports F/Canon


I decided to buy EF-S 55-250mm
