Hi, I am Mehdi HAROUN and I live in Paris / France.

I am a passionate Software Engineer and working in the Software Development. Although I focus on the backend / server side with C# (dotnet core / cross platform) and Golang I also have HTML, Javascript (mostly Angular) and CSS experience.

Since 2013 I worked on a lot of projects in all size for various sectors (finance/banks, health care, human resources, etc.). I was able to work in a lot of different roles ranging from development, technical project lead to architect and consulting.

Currently I am working as a Consultant & Developer at Cegid.
