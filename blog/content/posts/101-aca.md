## Docker / Container

a container is your program and all its dependencies packaged together
a container image is a file that contains all the dependencies and configuration required to run a program
a container engine is a program that runs containers

docker is a container engine
docker image is a container image
dockerfile is a file that contains instructions to build a docker image

FROM node:16-alpine3.14
WORKDIR /web
COPY ./index.js ./index.js

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "./index.js"]

docker build -f app.dockerfile . -t node-echo
docker images
docker run -t -i -p 5001:5001 node-echo

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that manages containers at scale

workload is an application (usually a web service) running in Kubernetes
Pod is a group of one or more containers that share storage and network resources

An application running on an operating system is called a process. When you run that program in a Docker environment, it becomes a container; When you run your container directly in Kubernetes, it becomes a Pod.
Node is a physical or virtual machine running Kubernetes, onto which Pods can be scheduled
Cluster is a set of nodes grouped together. Each cluster has a single control plane
A Kubernetes service defines networking between pods and how pod networks are exposed to the internet

kubectl cluster-info
kubectl apply -f node-echo-deployment.yaml
kubectl get deployments
kubectl apply -f node-echo-service.yaml
